# Lichess Blunder Analysis Tool
This project aims to automate the process of identifying and tracking blunders in chess games, specifically focusing on improving my chess skills to reach a 1800 rating.

The primary reference for this tool will be my own Lichess games. However, the design objective is to ensure its adaptability for use by any Lichess user.

For context, my current Lichess rapid rating stands at 1417, and my profile can be viewed here: [Sajal's Lichess Profile](https://lichess.org/@/sajal).

Previously, I have been manually logging my game blunders in a Google Sheets document. You can view this record here for reference: [Manual Blunder Tracking Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oDQJmTG68BoQ28TYhzJKk-xdOjC5-EdmZ-DyjR_9EVo/edit?usp=sharing).
